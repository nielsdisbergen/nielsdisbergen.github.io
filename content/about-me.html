          <h5 class="brown-text">A Little About Me</h5>
          <p class="light">

            <p>
            A Neuroscientist by training, fascinated by the <a class="brown-text" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK10900/" target="_blank"> Auditory Cortex,</a> passionate about data analysis method development, and crazy about programming and technology in general. Currently working on a PhD investigating how the human brain separates sounds in its environment. In other words, trying to understand how you manage to listen to your favorite music while ignoring the world around you.
            </p>

            <p>
            My interest in data analysis methods extends to any form, be it brain/neuroimaging data, sound recognition, natural images, <i>et cetera</i>. Within the realm of analysis methods, I am specifically interested in multivariate pattern recognition techniques, both <a class="brown-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning" target="_blank">supervised</a> an <a class="brown-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning" target="_blank">unsupervised</a>. I have a strong affinity to and interest in computational methods for the separation of multivariate signals, for example blind source separation methods such as Independent Component Analysis. Furthermore, I am very passionate about Bayesian inference and its application in both modeling and analysis methods. Within my PhD research I apply a multitude of these techniques to disentangle experimental effects in human brain data.
            </p>

            <p>
            Aside from mentioned topics, I am very much interested in the development of novel unsupervised neural modeling techniques which allow for node restriction based on prior statistical knowledge of both its output and hidden layers, as well as layer-specific feedback activations for enhanced performance improvements in mismatch states. More generally, adaptation of learning networks, for example the currently hyped deep learning network, to reduce learning efforts and allow incorporation of restrictions where deemed necessary. Not only does this allow more efficient and possibly better model fitting, it makes the use of such models in Neuroimaging analysis more useful. My interest here does not merely lie in model development, it is the bridging between Machine Learning for Neuroscience and Technology which interest me most. The cross-development of methods based on the brain as well as non-brain-based theoretical research provides a fantastic basis for both scientific and technological advancements to come.
            </p>

            <p>
            Overall, I am very passionate about employing programming for problem solving and automation of processes. A great deal of my private and professional time is spent developing novel approaches and/or algorithms to solve problems to optimize/automate handling of such difficulties in future encounters.

            <h5 class='brown-text'>Research</h5>
            <p>
            My research aims at understanding how the brain separates sounds in the environment which overlap both in time and frequency. A prominent example of such a situation would be having a conversation in a noisy environment, where you actively separate the speaker's voice from all other sounds surrounding you. Methods employed by the brain to resolve such a seemingly complex task, are described within the <a class="brown-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_scene_analysis" target="_blank">Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA)</a> framework. All sounds present in one’s environment are typically indicated as the auditory scene, analogous to a visual scene though made up of sounds. My research focuses on one of the sub-steps of ASA, namely auditory stream segregation.
            </p>
            <p>
            <a class="brown-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_scene_analysis#Grouping_and_streams" target="_blank">Auditory stream segregation</a> refers to the methods employed by the brain to separate overlapping environmental sounds into coherent perceptual representations (i.e. streams). Auditory streams may consist of one or multiple sound sources, depending on both physical cues as well as internal ‘brain states’. The combination of multiple sound sources into a ‘new’ sound is typically called auditory stream integration. Any form of stream segregation or integration makes use of two distinct types of information, namely <a class="brown-text" href="http://openpsyc.blogspot.com/2014/06/bottom-up-vs-top-down-processing.html" target="_blank">bottom-up and top-down</a>. Bottom-up information refers to the physical differences between sounds (e.g. pitch, timbre, onset, etc.), while top-down information refers to how the higher-levels of processing in the brain effect representations of sounds in earlier processing stages.
            </p>

            <p>
            To investigate how the brain performs these segregation and integration tasks for multiple instruments in a song, we employ multi-instrument/polyphonic counterpoint music. The physical difference between instruments (i.e. bottom-up) is modulated via instrument <a class="brown-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre" target="_blank">Timbre</a> manipulation. Top-down effects are varied by changing subject’s locus of attention. To visualize such effects in the brain, my preferred acquisition method is <a class="brown-text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging" target="_blank">functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)</a>. With fMRI it is possible to visualize, among others, which areas of the brain are showing changes in blood oxygenation levels, leading to the assumption that neurons in this area are (more or less) active. By comparing these changes across different experimental conditions, we may learn more about how the brain processes the variables manipulated in our experiments. Drawing any conclusions on measured blood oxygenation changes, requires the fMRI data to be processed and analyzed. It is the development of novel (combinations of) analysis methods for this kind of data which is one of my main professional interest. To acquire brain data, I make use of a 7 Tesla MRI scanner which is capable of providing very detailed images of the brain both in space and time.
